README:

Nowcasts are enerated based on the simple model also used in the COVID-19 Nowcast Hub, see description here: https://github.com/KITmetricslab/hospitalization-nowcast-hub/tree/main/code/baseline

As of 4 December 2022 the nowcasts are generated in real time (they are stored in a folder called data-processed_retrospective only because we are still building up the infrastructure).
