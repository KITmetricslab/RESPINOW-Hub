### Available epidemiological indicators

*Details on the various indicators are available [here](link).*

- **SARI hospitalization incidence (ICOSARI):** Weekly incidence (per 100,000 inhabitants) of new hospitalizations due to SARI (severe acute respiratory infections; ICD-10 codes J09 – J22). Data from approximately 70 sentinel hospitals.
- **SurvStat compulsory reporting data**: For a large number of communicable diseases, laboratory-confirmed cases are notifiable in Germany. The SurvStat system aggregates the resulting data. Here, data on invasive pneumococcal disease, RSV and seasonal influenza can be displayed. It must be noted that data on RSV currently only cover the state of Saxony.
- **ARI sentinel surveillance (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Influenza):** Consultation incidence for acute respiratory infections (ARI; ICD-10 codes J00 – J22, B34.9 and J44.0), per 100,000 inhabitants. Data come from the sentinel network of Arbeitsgruppe Influenza (more than 600 GP practices).
- **Virological surveillance in the National Reference Center**: Weekly numbers of PCR tests (total and positive) for RSV and seasonal influenza from the National Reference Center. Virological surveillance is embedded in the ARI sentinel surveillance.
- **Network Clinical Virology:** Weekly numbers of PCR tests (total and positive) for invasive pneumococcal disease, RSV and seasonal influenz in the Clinical Virology Network.
